> How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

- I used React and Redux because its easier to maintain and share state with other components and Webpack to transpile as im more familiar with it.

> Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- Make it production ready by Code splitting.

> What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

- I would add more re-usable components to the project so that its easier to implement once the app grows.
